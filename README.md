# What is this?

This git repository represents part of a collection of summaries of varying quality and extent.
It was created with the motivation to establish en effective basis for sharing knowledge and profiting from each others work. It allows using a common, working latex base by design.
The collection comprises summaries in german, in english, sometimes including a short version (which is usually more up to date than the long one - guess why...).

# Git rules

1. Use your own branch to commit.
2. Commit features, not your daily / weekly status.
3. Write [meaningful commit messsages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
    - Separate subject from body with a blank line
    - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    - Capitalize the subject line
    - Do not end the subject line with a period
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    - Wrap the body at 72 characters
    - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
4. When you find an error (content or environment) please make an [issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/) assigned to `muellegi`, describing the problem you found.

# Getting started

0. If you're new to git read an [introduction](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics).

1. Contact [me](mailto:muellegi@student.ethz.ch) to get access to one of the [available summaries](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/Headerfiles/blob/master/ListOfSummaries.md).

2. Choose a local folder to contain your summaries.

3. `cd` to `chosen folder` and clone the [Headerfiles](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/Headerfiles) repo:

    `git clone https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/Headerfiles`

4. Git will have created a `Headerfiles` folder in your `chosen folder`. Clone your chosen summary into that same `chosen folder`. 

    `git clone https://gitlab.ethz.ch/ZFSG/SummaryName`

5. Create your own branch, do your adaptation, push whenever you add a significant ammount of new content.

6. Contact [me](mailto:muellegi@student.ethz.ch) if you need help with git or latex or life in general (maybe not).
